				<p class="head4 mt-20">Our blog page has articles concerting the language on issues like updates and bugs fixed in the program. They are written by the Pazle developers so they may benefit you so pay some visits.</p>

					<div class="article">
						<p class="head5 underlined get">Pazle's speed is gonna increase.</p>
						<p class="txt">Dynamic languages are always slower and so there runtimes could be optimised to increase speed by surrendering so features like us, <span class="bold-6">Now we can only do operations on numbers only.</span> This is to increase pazle's speed but functions to do the missing exists.</p>

						<p class="txt mt-4">Still we research and test on ways to make the language faster, its written in very fast programming languages D and C so I can figure out a way. Never the less, I found out one that is gonna affect the <span class="bold-6">parsing</span> and <span class="bold-6">evaluation</span> steps. This could do alot even without turning the program to a JIT. So please keep connected and in contact for the great change that is just around the corner as you learn the language.</p>

						<p class="txt mt-3">If things go well, we may bring back the operations to strings and other datatypes so that we can have a real dynamic programming language that some of us dream of.</p>
					</div>


					<div class="article mt-10">
						<p class="head5 underlined get">Error reports is not finished.</p>
						<p class="txt">For now the language's error reports are the worse at time it even returns its source code instead for your program. But do not mind thats not the hardest to solve. In just days that will be no big deal.</p>
						<p class="txt mt-3">If you get an error complaining about <span class="bold-6">range</span> just know you didn't give a function call it's right number of arguments Or you are indexing an iterable out of it's range like an array.</p>

						<p class="head5 underlined get">Dev Team's word.</p>

					<div class="article mt-10">
						<p class="head5 underlined get">Version 0.1 was released on 01-01-2023.</p>
						<p class="txt">After making a good scheduling, the language was released on 01-01-2023. This release includes the first builtin modules and everything is in first hand. Since it is not stable, regular updates are made on the language.</p>
						<ul class="pt-2 pl-5">
							<li class="link mt-2">install v0.1 Pazle</li>
